### Build a project from Scratch

# Project Requirements
1. Creat a CLI
2. Links to exteranl data via an API
3. The data must go at least one level deep.  A level is where a user can make a choice and then get detailed information about their choice.  
    ** Examples: 
           * Libraries near you - Enter zip code and receive a list of libraries and their details
           * News reader - List articles and reand an article of your choosing
4. Good OO design. Create a collection of objects, not hashes, to store your data. Use an API and avoid scraping. 

### Flow
- Find an API (Find your data first)
- Set up a CLI (A file that will show the user some messages)
