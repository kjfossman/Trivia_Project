# Trivia_Project
Phase 1 Project Flatiron

## Motivation 
    - I started this project to give a quick easy way to play trivia games with friends.

## Language
    - This project is coded in Ruby, using Ruby 2.6.1

## Features
    - When using this application you can choose to play trivia games either by category or 
      randomized. 
    - For the category game you will select a category and answer all questions in that 
      category until they run out. Once the category is finished the game is over. 
    - For the randomly generated game you will be able to choose to be given anywhere from
      2-20 clues.  You and a friend will answer the clues until they run out.  
    - The app automatically tracks the score of your paticular game and declares a winner when
      there are no clues left to choose from.  

## How to use?
    - Simply run the "ruby bin/run" file and follow along with the prompts to get a game started. 
    - This will get you started in the game that you choose. When answering questions you will 
      be prompted to enter whether you got it correct or incorrect. This is to avoid a question
      being slightly misspelled resulting in someone not getting credit for it. 
    - Once you and a friend have answered all the questions, you are finished and to play again 
      run "ruby bin/run"
